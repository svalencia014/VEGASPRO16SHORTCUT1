Vegas Pro 16 AHK/TXT SHORTCUTS - 1 (V.1)



This software was made after finding out about Taran-VH's Premiere Macro Auto Hotkey Script. I do not use Adobe Premiere Pro so I needed to write my own to work with
Sony Vegas Pro 16. So far I have only been able to write scripts to change track color. This script should be the same for every 1920x1080 resolution monitor. If you 
have a razer Chroma Enabled Device I have a profile which will be in the chroma folder. This will contain colors and keyboard shortcuts. This file will be updated as I
make progress with the total keyboard shortcuts. Each script will contain info and a link to a video to see what the script does.


Where to find keyboard shortcuts - Look for the shortcuts.txt for the file.

SECTION 1- TRACK COLORS

Since the Coordinate for the track and the right click menu change for every track. So the num /, num *, num -, num +, num 0, and num . because I usually edit with 6 tracks. These colors are also used on the keyboard where the keys are mapped. The number pad is mapped while you are in the Sony Vegas Pro 16 keyboard profile. Numbers 1-9 (except for 5) are assigned to a different color (There are 8 Presets ranging from A-H.). Each number has a different RGB lighting value so you know what each one does. The 5 key on the number pad is for getting the current coordinates of the mouse for future reference. (If your software doesn't work then send screenshots of errors and coordinates if its not aligning with what its suppost to click.)

SECTION 2- Split and Delete & Fill

This feature I am adding in using autohotkey so I don't have to do a S & Ctrl + F. I just hit f when the main vegas window is in focus and it will send Delete (Delete Selected clip) and Ctrl + F (Fill gap). This should speed up editing a bit which acording to Taran will save a ton of time in the long run. This was done mainly because I hate having to do multiple key strokes for something I use pretty often. I am usually cutting out things and having to manually move the clips or hit Ctrl + F.

SECTION 3- Remapping of controls

For this feature I am remapping some controls. The J, K, and L keys are going to be remapped to Q, W, E. You can use either one whenever you desire. The media keys in the function row will do the same thing as J/Q, K/W, L/E. This will allow for faster editing as you don't have to move your hands to the J, K , and L keys to control playback.

SECTION 4- Misc Keys

This section will be describing what some random keys will do. 
The T key will add a new text layer to where your cursor is. = See this in action here - 
The R key will reverse the clip selected. = See this in action here -
