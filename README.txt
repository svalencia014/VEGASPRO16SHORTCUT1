Vegas Pro 16 AHK/TXT SHORTCUTS - 1 (V.1)



This software was made after finding out about Taran-VH's Premiere Macro Auto Hotkey Script. I do not use Adobe Premiere Pro so I needed to write my own to work with
Sony Vegas Pro 16. So far I have only been able to write scripts to change track color. This script should be the same for every 1920x1080 resolution monitor. If you 
have a razer Chroma Enabled Device I have a profile which will be in the chroma folder. This will contain colors and keyboard shortcuts. This file will be updated as I
make progress with the total keyboard shortcuts.

Last frame - Left arrow / Rewind (f5)        


SECTION 2- TRACK COLORS

This section will contain a "chart" with the color name and the RGB value so you can set them in your Vegas Software (I will show that later). These colors are also used on the keyboard where the keys are mapped. The number pad is mapped while you are in the Sony Vegas Pro 16 keyboard profile. Numbers 1-9 (except for 5) are assigned to a different color (There are 8 Presets ranging from A-H.). Each number has a different RGB lighting value so you know what each one does. The 5 key on the number pad is for getting the current coordinates of the mouse for future reference. (If your software doesn't work then send screenshots of errors and coordinates if its not aligning with what its suppost to click.)
